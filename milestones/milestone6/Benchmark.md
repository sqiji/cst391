### Descriptions:
#### Milestone 1: 
- In this milestone I create a project preposal, discribing the project that I will create and build throgh this course. I provide all the project detail design sitemap, UML, UI wireframe, database, and project model.

#### Milestone 2:
- This milestone does not differ from milestone 1 that much, which the requires for this milestone is to review milestone 1 and modefy it. In this milestone, I designed and created the Postman that is used for all my milestons in this class. 

### Milestone 3: 
- In this milestone a simple Rest API was create using Express framework. and the project was tested by typing the url such as localcost:5000/cars to get car list was used as well as was tested usign the Postman wich a collection with multiple request (get, post, put, delete) was created. The MAMP with mySQL was used for database, and mySQL queries were user to access the database.

### Milestone 4:
- This milestone was built using Angular. In this project the user can display the car list, add new car, update an existing car using id, and delete a car using id. Database creating usin mySQL and the MAMP is used to access the database by running the milestone 3 as server. The bootstrap was used for HTML and CSS.

### Milestone 5:
- This is milestone is the same as milestone four but was built using React insteadd of Angular. In this milestone user can display car using Card from Bootstrap. The Edit and Add new car age is desined using form, both are using the same page, the code is used to determine if it is a new car or editing and existing car, if it is editing an existing car then the fields will be felled with the car informatin and if it is a new car then the fields will use the placeholder text that are defined in HTML code.


### Pending:
Creare and implement User interface, that will allow the user create a username using Register Interface. then the user will be able to sing in to the web application using its own username and password to be able to add, modify, or delete a product (car) from the website. Oherwise the user will only be able to see the product (cars) only.
