Risks: 
One of the risks is how to add a picture to the database and what data type I should use. The other 
risk is how to connect the webpage to database server like MAMP using mySQL and JavaScript, I did 
that using with Java and C# in CST-345 Database Class using Connec on with database URL, username, 
and password. The other risk is security, what I mean by security is that everyone would not be able to 
edit the products in the system. Therefore, I added a user that will give access only to person with 
username and password to edit the products, such as adding new product, update or delete the 
product.
