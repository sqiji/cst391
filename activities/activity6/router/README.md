# Activity 6 Router App
This activity shows us how to handle protected routes where only authorized users can visit.  The isLoggedIn in state is initially set to false.  While it is false, the PrivateRoute component redirects the user to the LoginPage.  The LoginPage component declares a handleLogin function that sets the 'from' URL address location that a user was attempting to access before being redirected then calls the onClick that was passed from the App.js in the props.  props.onClick(from, navigate) calls that App.js event and passes the location along with the navigate function that was substantiated from userNavigate().  Then, handleLogin in App.js fires and sets isLoggedIn to true and reroutes the user to the URL they were trying to access before seeing the LoginPage.  This is accomplished with: navigate(from, {replace: true}).  Navigate is the routing function to send the user somewhere and the coordinates are the 'from' location that was just sent over from the LoginPage.  The replace: true gets rid of the LoginPage redirect URL so that the user doesn't go back to it if the select the browser's back button.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
